# Stock Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Stock Prediction using Machine Learning project repository! This project aims to leverage various machine learning techniques to predict stock prices and trends, helping investors make informed decisions.

## Overview

The Stock Prediction using Machine Learning project is designed to predict stock prices based on historical data and machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gather historical stock data from reliable sources.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and prepare data for model training.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement regression, classification, or deep learning models for stock price prediction.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
  
- **Prediction:** Make predictions on future stock prices and trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, prophet , streanlit
- yfinance or plot_plotly
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your stock data and place it in the designated directory.
4. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data analysis and model training.
5. Run the scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
6. Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains sample datasets and scripts for data preprocessing.
- **models:** Includes trained machine learning models and model evaluation scripts.
